# ITSC-SecureCoding Assignment
This project is an assignment for my software security course, the guidelines were to create a SECURE course registration program. It's quite simple, and most of the code was given to us by our teacher. We (my group) has only had to fill out a few classes and make minor changes in order for it to meet the instructors criteria.

Very Epic 👍
